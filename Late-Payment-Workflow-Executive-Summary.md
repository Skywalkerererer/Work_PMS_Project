## 🏊 Process Overview - 6 Swimlanes

### 1️⃣ Tenant / Occupant (Manual)
**Role**: Receive reminders, make payments, raise disputes  
**Key Actions**:
- Receive multi-channel notices (Email, SMS, Letter, Phone)
- Choose payment method (FPS, Autopay, Bank, Cheque, Card)
- Raise disputes when charges are incorrect

**Pain Point Addressed**: Currently confusing manual processes → Now clear, automated, bilingual communications

---

### 2️⃣ PMS - Billing & Dunning Engine (Fully Automated)
**Role**: Core automation engine  
**Key Functions**:
1. **Daily Scheduler**: Identify all overdue invoices (aging analysis)
2. **Exclusion Logic**: Auto-skip disputed accounts, payment plans, VIP holds
3. **Level Computation**: Calculate dunning tier based on days past due
4. **Fee Application**: Auto-apply late fees at D+14 (5% per month, HKD 50 min)
5. **Case Creation**: Generate dunning case with full invoice history
6. **Payment Monitoring**: Detect payments, auto-allocate, close cases
7. **Audit Logging**: Immutable trail of all actions

**Pain Point Addressed**: 80% manual effort in Excel → Now 95%+ automated

---

### 3️⃣ Communications Service (Automated with Monitoring)
**Role**: Multi-channel message delivery  
**Channels**:
- **Email**: HTML templates with payment links (EN/ZH)
- **SMS**: 160-char alerts with FPS payment codes
- **Letter**: Physical mail for D+14, D+30, D+45 (registered)
- **Phone**: Outbound call tasks for bounced messages or D+21

**Features**:
- Delivery tracking (bounces, opens, clicks)
- Template versioning and A/B testing
- Time-of-day rules (HK business hours)
- Unsubscribe management (with legal override)

**Pain Point Addressed**: Inconsistent messaging → Now standardized, bilingual, tracked

---

### 4️⃣ AR / Collections Team (Semi-Automated)
**Role**: Manual intervention for exceptions  
**When Involved**:
- Review dunning queue (D+30+ cases, high-value, bounced comms)
- Handle payment plans (offer, capture terms, monitor compliance)
- Coordinate dispute resolution with Property Managers
- Manage exceptions (goodwill waivers, manual holds)

**Workload Reduction**: From 100% of cases → Only 15-20% requiring human touch

**Tools**:
- Priority queue dashboard (sorted by age, amount, property)
- Payment plan wizard (auto-generate installment schedules)
- One-click dispute flagging (auto-pauses dunning)
- Promise-to-pay tracking with auto-reminders

**Pain Point Addressed**: Overwhelmed AR team → Now focus on high-value exceptions

---

### 5️⃣ Property Manager (Approval & Investigation)
**Role**: Dispute resolution and charge adjustments  
**Responsibilities**:
1. **Investigate Disputes**: Review tenant claims, check records, consult teams
2. **Decision Making**: 
   - **Valid** → Issue credit note, adjust future billing
   - **Invalid** → Reject with rationale, resume dunning
3. **Approval**: Sign off on service holds, final notices (D+45)
4. **Documentation**: Complete case notes for audit trail

**SLA**: 5 business days to resolve (tracked automatically)

**Pain Point Addressed**: Disputes lost in email → Now tracked with SLAs and alerts

---

### 6️⃣ Finance / Legal Escalation (Governance)
**Role**: Final escalation and legal referrals  
**Thresholds**:
- **D+45 OR Amount > HKD 10,000**: Manager approval + final notice
- **D+60 OR Amount > HKD 50,000**: Legal/DCA referral
- **D+90 AND Amount > HKD 5,000**: Mandatory legal action

**Actions**:
1. **Final Notice**: Registered letter with service hold warning
2. **Service Hold**: Suspend access cards, facility booking, parking
3. **Legal Referral**: Auto-compile case file (invoices, comms, lease, history)
4. **DCA/Lawyer**: Hand off to external collections

**Pain Point Addressed**: Late escalations → Now automated triggers with full documentation

## 💡 Key Design Innovations

### 1. Intelligent Exclusion Engine
**Problem**: Over-dunning causes tenant complaints and wasted effort  
**Solution**: Auto-exclude accounts with:
- Active disputes (dunning paused until resolved)
- Approved payment plans (installments monitored separately)
- Manual holds (VIP, government, special arrangements)
- Recent payments (grace period to allow processing)

### 2. Real-Time Payment Integration
**Problem**: Payments made but reminders still sent (tenant frustration)  
**Solution**: 
- FPS integration with unique payment references (instant matching)
- Bank file imports 3x daily (Autopay, telegraphic transfers)
- Auto-allocation engine (95%+ success rate)
- Payment posting triggers immediate case closure

### 3. Multi-Channel with Fallback
**Problem**: Email/SMS bounces = lost contact opportunity  
**Solution**:
- Delivery confirmation tracking
- Bounce detection triggers phone call task
- Multiple contact methods per tenant (primary, alternate, emergency)
- Letter escalation for digital channel failures

### 4. Payment Plan Intelligence
**Problem**: Partial payments lead to confusion and re-work  
**Solution**:
- Auto-detect partial payment (amount < invoice total)
- System offers payment plan based on outstanding balance
- Capture installment schedule in system
- Auto-reminders for upcoming installments
- Auto-resume dunning if plan breached

### 5. Dispute SLA Enforcement
**Problem**: Disputes drag on for weeks without resolution  
**Solution**:
- SLA timer starts upon dispute flag (target: 5 business days)
- Auto-escalate to manager if breached
- Daily alerts to assigned Property Manager
- Dashboard showing dispute queue and aging

### 6. One-Click Case File for Legal
**Problem**: Legal referrals require hours of manual document compilation  
**Solution**:
- Auto-compile case package: invoices, all communications sent, payment history, lease terms, tenant contact, property details
- PDF generation with index and timeline
- Secure handoff to DCA/lawyer portal
- Track legal case status in PMS

## 🎓 Lessons from HK Market Best Practices

### What Works in Hong Kong Property Management

1. **Bilingual by Default**: All tenant comms must be EN/ZH (50/50 split in HK)
2. **FPS Dominance**: Faster Payment System now preferred over cheques (60%+ adoption)
3. **Relationship-First**: Balance automation with personal touch for high-value tenants
4. **DMC Compliance**: Deed of Mutual Covenant governs late fees (typically 5% per month max)
5. **Service Hold Leverage**: Effective threat (access cards, parking) but requires contract terms
6. **Legal as Last Resort**: Small Claims Tribunal efficient for < HKD 75,000 claims
7. **Seasonal Awareness**: Lower collections during CNY, Christmas; plan accordingly

### Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ **Over-Automation**: Don't eliminate all human touchpoints (tenant alienation)
- ❌ **One-Size-Fits-All**: Different portfolios need different dunning strategies
- ❌ **Ignoring Disputes**: Must resolve quickly or lose goodwill and legal standing
- ❌ **Late Fee Rigidity**: Sometimes waiver is best for long-term relationship
- ❌ **Poor Translation**: Machine translation = loss of face; use native speakers
- ❌ **Data Silos**: Payment data must sync real-time or risk duplicate reminders
