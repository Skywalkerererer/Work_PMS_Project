# Late Payment Reminder To-Be Workflow - Design Documentation

## Executive Summary

As a senior business analyst with 20+ years in Hong Kong property management, this design represents a **modern, automated dunning workflow** aligned with local market practices, regulatory requirements (PDPO), and best-in-class collection strategies for property management.

---

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Automation-First**: Minimize manual intervention while maintaining human oversight at critical decision points
2. **PDPO Compliance**: Full consent management, bilingual communications, and comprehensive audit trails
3. **Graduated Escalation**: Progressive dunning ladder from courtesy to legal action
4. **Exception Handling**: Automatic suspension for disputes, payment plans, and special accounts
5. **Multi-Channel Communication**: Email, SMS, Letter, and Phone with delivery tracking

---

## Swimlane Structure

### 6 Key Roles/Systems

| Swimlane | Responsibility | Automation Level |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| **Tenant / Occupant** | Receives notices, makes payments, raises disputes | Manual |
| **PMS - Billing & Dunning Engine** | Scheduler, aging analysis, fee application, case management | Fully Automated |
| **Communications Service** | Multi-channel message delivery, bounce detection | Automated with monitoring |
| **AR / Collections Team** | Review exceptions, handle disputes, offer payment plans | Semi-automated |
| **Property Manager** | Investigate disputes, approve adjustments | Manual with workflow |
| **Finance / Legal** | Final escalation, legal referrals | Approval-based |

---

## Process Flow Design - Key Stages

### Stage 1: Daily Automated Identification (PMS Engine)

**Trigger**: Daily scheduler (typically runs early morning)

**Process**:
1. **Identify Overdue Invoices**: Aging analysis across all active accounts
2. **Exclusion Check**: Auto-exclude accounts with:
   - Active disputes
   - Approved payment plans
   - Manual holds (VIP, government, special arrangements)
3. **Dunning Level Computation**: Calculate days past due and determine appropriate action tier
4. **Late Fee Application**: Apply charges if crossed threshold (typically D+14 in HK market)
5. **Case Creation**: Generate dunning case with full invoice detail and history

**HK Best Practice Alignment**:
- Respects public holidays (Hong Kong calendar)
- Handles month-end processing cycles
- Supports multiple property portfolios with different policies

---

### Stage 2: Multi-Channel Communication

**Communication Matrix**:

| Days Overdue | Channel | Language | Tone | Late Fee |
|--------------|---------|----------|------|----------|
| D+3 | Email + SMS | EN/ZH | Courtesy reminder | None |
| D+7 | Email + SMS | EN/ZH | First formal notice | None |
| D+14 | Email + Letter | EN/ZH | Second notice | Applied (if enabled) |
| D+21 | Phone Call | EN/ZH | Warning (service hold) | Accumulating |
| D+30 | Email + Letter | EN/ZH | Final notice | Service hold initiated |
| D+45 | Registered Letter | EN/ZH | Demand letter | Manager approval |
| D+60+ | Legal referral | EN/ZH | Legal proceedings | Full amount due |

**Delivery Tracking**:
- **Bounce Detection**: Email/SMS delivery failures trigger phone call escalation
- **Read Receipts**: Track message opening (email tracking pixels)
- **SMS Delivery**: HK telecom delivery confirmations
- **Letter Proof**: Registered mail tracking numbers

**PDPO Compliance**:
- Consent records for each communication channel
- Unsubscribe management (with regulatory override for payment notices)
- Purpose limitation - only payment-related communications
- PII masking in reports and logs

---

### Stage 3: Tenant Response Handling

**Three Possible Tenant Actions**:

#### 3A: Payment Made
- **Channels**: FPS, Bank Transfer, Autopay, Cheque, Credit Card, Alipay/WeChat Pay
- **Auto-Allocation**: System automatically matches payment to outstanding invoices
- **Full Payment**: Case auto-closed, dunning stops immediately
- **Partial Payment**: Triggers payment plan offer workflow

**HK Payment Method Specifics**:
- **FPS (Faster Payment System)**: Real-time matching via unique payment reference
- **Autopay**: Pre-authorized recurring payments with failure handling
- **Cheque**: OCR scanning for automated posting (with manual verification queue)
- **Cash**: Requires receipt issuance with proper audit trail

#### 3B: Dispute Raised
- **Suspension**: Dunning automatically paused upon dispute flag
- **SLA Timer**: Property Manager must investigate within 5 business days
- **Investigation**: Review invoice accuracy, service delivery, billing errors
- **Resolution Paths**:
  - **Valid Dispute**: Issue credit note, adjust charges, case closed
  - **Invalid Dispute**: Reject with explanation, resume dunning from previous level

**Common HK Dispute Scenarios**:
- Incorrect management fee calculation
- Service charge disputes (facilities not available)
- Meter reading errors (utilities)
- Unauthorized charges
- Double-billing

#### 3C: No Response
- **Auto-Escalation**: System progresses to next dunning level per ladder
- **Collections Team Review**: Manual review for high-value or aged cases
- **Payment Plan Offer**: Proactive outreach for partial payment arrangements

---

### Stage 4: AR Collections Team Functions

**Manual Intervention Points**:

1. **Dunning Queue Review**:
   - Dashboard showing all active cases by aging bucket
   - Priority sorting: Amount, Age, Property, Tenant type
   - Workload distribution among team members

2. **Payment Plan Management**:
   - **Offer Criteria**: Partial payment received or tenant request
   - **Terms Capture**: Payment schedule, amounts, dates
   - **Monitoring**: Auto-alerts for missed installments
   - **Auto-Resume**: Dunning restarts if plan breached

3. **Dispute Coordination**:
   - Flag disputes in system
   - Route to Property Manager
   - Track resolution SLAs
   - Communicate outcomes to tenant

4. **Exception Handling**:
   - Manual holds for special circumstances
   - Goodwill adjustments (senior management approval)
   - Write-off recommendations (aged uncollectible)

**HK Market Practices**:
- Collections team typically reviews cases D+30 and above
- Phone calls made during HK business hours (09:00-18:00 HKT)
- Bilingual capability essential
- Relationship management for high-value tenants

---

### Stage 5: Property Manager Dispute Resolution

**Investigation Process**:

1. **Gather Evidence**:
   - Original lease/deed of mutual covenant
   - Service delivery records
   - Meter readings/utility bills
   - Correspondence history
   - Previous payment patterns

2. **Stakeholder Consultation**:
   - Building management office
   - Facilities/maintenance teams
   - Finance team
   - Legal (for complex cases)

3. **Decision Making**:
   - **Valid**: Issue credit note, adjust future billings, apologize
   - **Invalid**: Provide detailed rejection rationale, resume collection

4. **Documentation**:
   - Complete case notes
   - Attach supporting documents
   - Audit trail for compliance

**SLA Commitments**:
- Initial response: 2 business days
- Full investigation: 5 business days
- Complex cases: 10 business days (with interim updates)
